# Kilterboard Climbing Competition App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project designed to facilitate small-scale friendly climbing competitions using the Kilterboard. It's bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and utilizes the latest features of Next.js 13, including the new `app` directory structure.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and user management with [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/).
- **Data Validation**: Robust form handling and validation using [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).
- **DataBase**: JSON based noSQL.
  [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a popular NoSQL database that is easy to set up and use.
- **Styling**: Modern UI components styled with [Shad CDN](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

## Development Status

The app is currently under active development. Our goal is to create open events where users can attempt a curated list of climbing problems within a specified time frame and at a set angle. A public dashboard will display the leading points of users, adding a competitive edge to the climbing experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with development:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Alternatively, if you prefer yarn, pnpm, or bun:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

Open [Root](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
